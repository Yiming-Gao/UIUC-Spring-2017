# Week 11 Overview #

## Probabilistic Programming ##

This week we introduce Bayesian Model fitting. In the Bayesian approach, we compute the likelihood of a model given observed data. This is a popular technique since we obtain posterior distributions on our model parameters. First, we will explore the general concepts in Bayesian model fitting and learn how to us the pymc3 library to compute the model parameters, sample from the likelihood, and evaluate the resulting fit. Next, we will learn about hierarchical model fitting, where both the entire data and subsets of the data re fit at the same time. Finally, we will explore general linear modeling, where he model errors are allowed to be non-Gaussian.

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ######

- Understand the basic concepts of Bayesian Mode regression
- Understand the fundamentals of hierarchical model fitting.
- Understand the basic principles of general linear modeling.
- Be able to use the pymc3 library to compute Bayesian model fitting,
  including hierarchical models and general linear model

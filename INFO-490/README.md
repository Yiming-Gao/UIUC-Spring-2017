This class is an asynchronous, online course. This course will introduce
and explore advanced data science concepts through practical
demonstration of algorithms and technologies on cloud computing systems.

Students will learn about the basic tasks in machine learning, including
the importance of data preparation. Next, linear regression is
introduced along with concepts like regularization and an extension to
logistic regression. Supervised learning is introduced with examples for
both classification and regression presented including naive Bayes,
k-nn, SVM, decision trees, and ensemble techniques. Unsupervised
techniques are presented with applications in both clustering and
dimensional reduction. Specific application areas are explored for
these machine learning techniques, including text analysis, network
analysis, and social media analysis. The last part of the course focuses
on cloud computing technologies, including Hadoop, MapReduce, NoSQL data
stores, Spark, and streaming data analysis. The course concludes with a
brief introduction of deep learning.

Students will be expected to use the course JupyterHub server, which
requires a fairly modern web browser. While we do not recommend it, a
modern tablet or smartphone can be used to access the course material.
However, to write and run programs, it is much more efficient to use a
standard computer with a regular keyboard. However, you can use
publicly available computers (for example, in the Library) if
necessary, to access the cloud resources in this class.

This class is open to sophomores, juniors, seniors and graduate students
in any discipline who have met the required pre-requisites or have the
permission of the instructor.

Please refer to the [course syllabus](orientation/syllabus.md) for more
information about course content and grading policies.

**If you have any questions, or if something is not working properly,
*PLEASE* look through the _Moodle Q&A Forum_ and the course FAQ wiki
page (please look at the right tool bar on the Github course page and
click the icon labeled "Wiki" that looks like an open book), before
either posting a new forum post or emailing the TA or the course
instructor.**

# Week 13 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Document-Oriented Databases ##

In this lesson, you will about document oriented databases, which are a flexible approach to persisting large, possibly unstructured data with a flexible schema. One of the most popular document databases is MongoDB. After introducing MongoDB, we will introduce how to work with MongoDB from a Python program by using the pymongo database driver. This will allow us to write Python programs that create documents in MongoDB, and insert, update, and delete documents from MongoDB.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of a document database like MongoDB
- Be familiar with the technique of connecting to a MongoDB from a Python program
- Be able to use the pymongo database driver to insert, update, select, and delete documents in a MongoDB instance.

### Time Estimate ###

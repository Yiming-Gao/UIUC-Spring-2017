# Week 13 Overview #

## NoSQL DataStores ##

This week we introduce NoSQL Databases, which are generally recent additions to the database world that provide functionality beyond that provided by traditional relational databases, often to enable fast processing of very large data sets. Typically these systems differ from a relational database by violating a specific item in the relational database _ACID_ test. Often this is consistency, which means that a select query might return different results depending on when it is run. This might be important for a shopping cart application for an online retailer, for example, who might be more interested in fast responses to user requests than an exact count of the number of items remaining in the inventory. These types of databases can also be based on specific types of data, such as document data or graph data structures. 

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ######

- Understand the basic concepts of a NoSQL database.
- Understand the basics of documented-oriented, column-oriented, and graph databases
- Understand how to connect to these database from a Python program.
- Be able to insert, update, select, and delete data from these database by using a Python program.

# Week 5 Lesson 2 #
## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction to Clustering ##

In this lesson, you will learn about the Unsupervised Learning technique
of clustering. Cluster finding can be used to find groups or clusters
(the difference between these is generally the size of the identified
set of points, groups are smaller than clusters). Cluster finding is a
very popular machine learning technique since it can be used to find
related items in a much larger data set or to summarize data by focusing
on the identified clusters as opposed to the much larger data. In this
lesson, we focus on two simple, yet popular cluster detection
techniques: k-means and DBSCAN.   

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind clustering
- Understand the basic concepts behind the k-means and DBSCAN algorithms
- Be able to apply k-means and DBSCAN by using the scikit learn library

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 5 Lesson 3 #
## Unsupervised Learning: Density Estimation ##

In this lesson, you will learn about density estimation. Often, as part
of exploratory data analysis, a histogram is used to understand how data
are distributed, and in fact this technique can be used to compute a
probability mass function (or PMF) from a data set. However, the binning
approach has issues, including a dependance on the number and width of
the bins used to compute the histogram. One approach to overcome these
issues is to fit a function to the binned data, which is known as
parametric estimation. Alternatively, we can construct an approximation
to the data by employing a non-parametric density estimation. The most
commonly used non-parametric technique is kernel density estimation (or
KDE). In this lesson, you will learn about density estimation and
specifically how to employ KDE.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind both parametric and non-parametric density estimation
- Understand the basic concepts behind kernel density estimation
- Be able to apply KDE by using the scikit learn library
- Understand how to use density estimation to approximate or smooth discrete data.

### Time Estimate ###

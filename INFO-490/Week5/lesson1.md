# Week 5 Lesson 1 #
## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction to Dimension Reduction ##

In this lesson, you will gain an introduction to Unsupervised Learning,
specifically via dimension reduction. Dimension reduction is used to
identify the statistically most important dimensions in a data set,
either for visualization (as we have been doing with the Iris data set)
or further processing. In some cases, dimension reduction can be used
for optimal feature selection. The most basic form of dimension
reduction is principal component analysis, or PCA. We can apply PCA to
a data set by using the scikit learn library.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the reasons for performing dimension reduction
- Understand the basic concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Be able to apply  PCA to a data set by using the scikit learn library
- Be aware of alternative dimension reduction techniques including
incremental PCA, sparse PCA, and non-negative matrix factorization.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

## Optional Readings ##

- A [gentle introduction][gipca], including the linear algebra required to understand PCA.

- A [detailed coverage][crpca] of dimensional reduction techniques.

- Sections 10.2 from [Introduction to Statistical Learning][isl]  by
Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

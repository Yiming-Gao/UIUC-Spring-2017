# Week 12 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to MapReduce ##

In this lesson, you will learn about MapReduce. MapReduce is a processing paradigm where a computing task is broken into a Map phase, where a function is mapped onto data and a reduce phase, where the results of the Map phase are aggregated. The Hadoop platform was initially designed to facilitate bulk processing of text data, such as computing unigrams. In this case, the Map phase would be to find unigrams, while the reduce phase would be to count the number of occurrences for each unigram. This is done by creating key-value pairs in the map phase, such as a token and the number one; and in the reduce phase summing up the one values for every adjacent, identical token. The Hadoop platform, by default, sorts the output of the map phase and aggregates them for the reducer task. 

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the Map/Reduce paradigm
- Be familiar with the YARN resource scheduler
- Be able to use Hadoop Streaming to process a Python based map/reduce application

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 12 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Pig ##

In this lesson, you will learn about Hadoop Pig. One problem with the Hadoop MapReduce paradigm is the challenge of creating map and reduce programs. To simplify this task, a new language, called Pig Latin, was created to simplify the creation of Map Reduce tasks. Pig is an ETL (extract, transform, load) language, that is similar in many respect to SQL (or Pandas). As a result, it can be simple to load multiple data sets, process them, group them, and join the results, before saving them to a new file.

### Objectives ###

- Understand the basic concepts of Apache Pig

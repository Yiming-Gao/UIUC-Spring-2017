# Week 12 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Hadoop ##

In this lesson, you will about Hadoop, which is a dominant platform for big data processing. Hadoop is an open source Java project that enables scalable, distributed computing. At its core, Hadoop moves the computations to the data. To do this,  Hadoop utilizes a custom, distributed file system known as HDFS. With HDFS, data is chunked into blocks, and these blocks are distributed (with replication) across the nodes in the Hadoop system. In this manner, processing can be scaled up to large numbers of nodes, and not fail if a small number of nodes fail, since the data are processed multiple times by different nodes. Since we do not have sufficient compute resources, we will run a single-node instance of Hadoop in this course, which will allow you to learn how to use Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce, and Pig, but not experience the speed and power of a full Hadoop cluster.

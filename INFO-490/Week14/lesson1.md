# Week 14 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Spark ##

In this lesson, you will about Spark, a popular new approach to processing big data. Spark provides an alternative to the Map-Reduce approach for processing tasks on Hadoop. Spark was built around a concept called Resilient Distributed Datasets (or RDDs). In this lesson, we introduce Spark, demonstrate how to perform basic operations within Spark, before introducing RDDs and how to perform basic data processing. All Spark processing is done locally this week, but the basic concepts all extend to larger Hadoop clusters, and the processing is done by using Python via pySpark.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of Spark
- Be familiar with an RDD
- Be able to use pySpark to create Spark applications from within an IPython Notebook.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

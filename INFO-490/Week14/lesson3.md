# Week 14 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Spark Machine Learning ##

In this lesson, you will learn about Spark Machine Learning. Spark machine learning encompasses two packages: Spark MLlib and Spark ML. The former operates on RDDs, while the latter, which is less well developed, operates on DataFrames. In this lesson, we focus on MLlib, which includes functionality for basic statistics functionality, as well as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensional reduction. In this lesson you will not only learn about the MLlib package, but specifically how to use pySpark to use this functionality to generate models from large data sets.


### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic contents of the Spark ML package
- Be familiar with basic statistical analysis by using the Spark ML package
- Be able to use pySpark to perform machine learning by using Spark.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

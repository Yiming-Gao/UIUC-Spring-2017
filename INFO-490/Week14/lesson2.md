# Week 14 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Spark DataFrames ##

In this lesson, you will learn about Spark DataFrames, which are an alternative to the Spark RDDs. With the growth in popularity of higher level languages such as Python and R for data analytic tasks, a consensus emerged that RDDs were less than ideal for performing Spark data processing tasks. As a result, DataFrames (similar to Pandas DataFrames) were introduced into Spark. In this Notebook, we introduce the Spark DataFrame and demonstrate how to use this new data structure for big data processing within a Spark environment.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of a Spark DataFrame
- Be familiar with using SQL on a Spark DataFrame 
- Be able to use pySpark to work with a Spark DataFrame

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 14 Overview #

## Introduction to Spark ##

This week we introduce Spark, a popular big data processing environment. Spark provides a non Map-Reduce framework on top of Hadoop. Spark also provides specific data structures, including the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) and DataFrame that simplify big data processing tasks. In this course, we will use pySpark to perform Spark processing from within an IPython Notebook.

### Objectives ###

- Understand the basic concepts of Spark
- Understand and be able to use Spark RDDs and DataFrames 
- Be able to execute Spark tasks in a Hadoop environment

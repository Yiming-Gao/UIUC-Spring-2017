# Week 1 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Linear Regression ##

In this lesson you will learn how to perform basic linear regression by using Python, which is one of the simplest techniques to construct a predictive model from a data set.


### Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of simple linear regression.
- Understand how to construct a linear model for a data set in Python by using the `statsmopdel` library.
- Understand how to construct a linear model for a data set in Python by using the `scikit_learn` library.

### Time Estimate###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 1 Overview#

## Introduction to Machine Learning ##

In this week, you will learn basic concepts about machine learning, including the basic Python libraries that we will use repeatedly throughout this course. This includes learning how to use scikit learn to perform different types of machine learning as well as the scikit learn (`sklearn`) and `statsmodel` libraries to perform regression. We also will explore the important, and often overlooked task, of data pre-processing. This includes handling missing or invalid data, computation of dates, and understanding the data provenance.

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Know the basics concepts that underlie machine learning.
- Understand the importance of data preparation to enable a successful machine learning analysis.
- Understand the basic concepts of linear regression.

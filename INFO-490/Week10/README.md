# Week 10 Overview #

## Network Analysis ##

This week we introduce basic network analysis by using the Python NetworkX library. First, we will introduce basic graph concepts such as a node, edge, and the difference between directed and undirected graphs. Next, we will discuss matrix representations of graph data, graph visualizations, and basic graph analysis including quantifying graph distances, diameter, and density. After this, we will discus graph traversal and exploration. Finally, we will learn how to apply these concepts to analyze social media data.

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ######

- Understand the basic concepts and representations of a graph
- Understand basic graph analytic techniques
- Be able to create and visualize a graph in Python by using the NetworkX library.
- Be able to apply network analysis techniques to social media in Python.

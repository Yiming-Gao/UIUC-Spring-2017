# Week 10 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Network Analysis: Graph Concepts ##

In this lesson, you will learn basic graph concepts in network analysis. Specifically, we will start by introducing the concept of a node, and how nodes can be connected in a graph by edges. Next, we will contrast undirected and directed graphs, before discussing how graphs, nodes, and edges can all posses attributes. We will also explore the underlying graph matrix representations including the adjacency and incidence matrices. Finally, we will learn how to perform basic graph visualizations in Python.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic graph concepts including nodes and edges.
- Be familiar with the differences between undirected and directed graphs.
- Understand the relationship between a graph and its adjacency and incidence matrices.
- Be able to create and visualize a graph in Python by using the NetworkX library.

### Time Estimate ###

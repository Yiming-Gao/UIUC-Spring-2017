# Week 10 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Network Analysis: Graph Analysis ##

In this lesson, you will learn about special types of graphs, including cycles, complete graphs, and complete bipartite graphs. Next, you will learn about traversing graphs, which can be done via a depth-first search, a breadth-first search, or a general exploration. Finally, you will learn about algorithms for analyzing the data represented by a graph to compute distance, diameter, and density by using the NetworkX Python library.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic graph families including complete graphs, bipartite graphs, and cycles.
- Be familiar with the analysis of graphs including the concepts of density, distance, diameter, and graph traversal.
- Be able to apply basic graph analysis techniques in Python by using NetworkX.

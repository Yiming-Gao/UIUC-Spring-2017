    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this IPython Notebook, we introduce the concept of a [Recommender\n",
    "System][rs]. Recommender systems are among the most popular machine\n",
    "learning techniques, and, in general, encompass a number of different\n",
    "types of machine learning algorithms that we have covered including\n",
    "classification, regression, and clustering. Some of the most popular\n",
    "recommender system approaches, however, are different and are\n",
    "fundamentally tied to data management. The classic example of a\n",
    "recommender system, is the market basket analysis, where data mining is\n",
    "performed on purchase transaction logs to first learn what types of\n",
    "objects are bought together (e.g, peanut butter and jelly) in order to, second,\n",
    "predict what someone might be interested in buying once they have\n",
    "selected an item (e.g., when peanut butter has been added to the cart,\n",
    "recommend jelly).\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the data structures that support this type  of analysis\n",
    "are known as frequent sets, since we collect sets of frequently\n",
    "purchased items. The most famous algorithm in this category is the [_a\n",
    "priori_][wap] algorithm, where we use what we have learned from previous\n",
    "transactions to make predictions before (i.e., _a priori_ information)\n",
    "someone completes a transaction. More generally, these algorithms are\n",
    "known as _collaborative filtering_, since the algorithm collaboratively\n",
    "filters through records of many individuals to identify trends.\n",
    "Formally, these types of algorithms are used to make recommendations,\n",
    "hence the name _recommender systems_. In addition to the traditional\n",
    "_market basket_ analysis, these algorithms are also used to make\n",
    "recommendations for video, such as Netflix or Hulu, and audio sites, such\n",
    "as Pandora or Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, anyone who has shopped online has been exposed to these\n",
    "algorithms. For example, at Amazon, when you are viewing the page for a\n",
    "particular item, you also are presented information on _other items you\n",
    "might be interested in_ and on _what other items people buy instead_.\n",
    "The first case is an example of item-based collaborative filtering,\n",
    "where the results of other items people have purchased together with\n",
    "this item are identified. The second is an example of user-based\n",
    "collaborative filtering, where the results from other, similar users,\n",
    "are used to identify items that might be of interest. Sometimes,\n",
    "however, the [results of this analysis can be problematic][tpg], and one\n",
    "should always be considerate of the impact predictions might have on the\n",
    "end user (this is clearly an area where _big brother_ impacts everyone).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we explore a sample data set, movie reviews, that can\n",
    "be used to learn more about recommender systems. Since Python does not\n",
    "(yet) have a standard implementation of recommender systems, we instead\n",
    "develop a single, user-based collaborative filtering example that uses\n",
    "the movie review data to make recommendations for new movies.\n",

    "who is most _similar_ to the current user, and use the ratings from this\n",
    "one similar user to make recommendations. To do this, we need two\n",
    "things. First, we need a matrix that contains the movie ratings, indexed\n",
    "by the user id and the movie id. This allows us to find movies to\n",
    "recommend, given a particular user. Second, we need a definition of\n",
    "similarity, which implies a [distance measurement][scdm] (more similar\n",
    "things should be close, while different things should be far apart).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we will employ cosine similarity. However, we will not\n",

    "appropriate for what we need. The cosine similarity treats two sets of\n",
    "data as vectors. For example, we can make a vector for each user where\n",
    "each element in the array corresponds to a rating for a specific movie.\n",
    "obviously, for a rating system with many movies, these vectors are\n",
    "extremely long (in our case, there are $10, 325$ elements). The cosine\n",
    "similarity is calculated by multiplying these two vectors and dividing\n",
    "by their length. Thus, this measurement will be scaled to lie between\n",
    "$-1$ and $1$. If the value is one, the vectors are identical. If the\n",
    "value is minus one, the vectors are exactly opposite of each other. And\n",
    "if the value is zero, the vectors are perpendicular to each other. As a\n",
    "result, the cosine similarity is measuring the angle between the two\n",
    "vectors.\n",

# Week 6 Overview #

## Machine Learning ##

This week you will build on previous lessons to learn about two specific
machine learning topics: recommender systems and outlier detection, as
well as a number of practical concepts that can improve both the
efficacy and performance of a machine learning technique. Recommender
systems are ubiquitous and are used to provide recommendations to a user
based on previously collected data either from other users, the current
user, or both. Anomaly detection is a rich field that focuses on
detecting data that do not follow previously established rules or
expectations. Finally, we will introduce a number of concepts that can be
used to improve either how well an algorithm works or its execution
efficiency (or both).

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ######

- Understand the basic concepts of a recommendation system and how they
  are used.
- Understand the basic principles of anomaly detection and the different
  areas in which this technique is applied.
- Understand how to apply practical concepts such as feature scaling,
  feature selection, cross-validation, and grid search to improve the
  performance of a machine learning technique.

# Week 6 Lesson 3 #

## Machine Learning: Practical Concepts ##

In this lesson, you will learn about several related practical concepts
that can improve the performance of a machine learning application.
First is feature scaling, which is used to change the distribution of
values for each feature in order to more effectively compare different
dimensions. Second is feature selection, which identifies the most
important features in a data set for a particular machine learning
approach. Third, is the concept of a pipeline where different components
in the machine learning process can be combined to run more efficiently.
Fourth is cross-validation, where multiple different train/test splits
are used to explore the efficacy of an algorithm to all of the data.
Fifth is the use of a grid search to identify optimal hyperparameters
for a machine learning algorithm,. Finally, we look at validation and
learning curves, which provide visual guidance on the effectiveness of a
particular algorithm and parameter values.

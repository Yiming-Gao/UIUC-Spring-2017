# Week 6 Lesson 1 #
## Machine Learning: Introduction to Recommender Systems ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to recommendation systems. Anyone
who has used Internet sites for shopping has been exposed to a
recommendation system. For example, when you shop at Amazon, you will be
given recommendations for items that are often bought together and also
items that are similar to the current item of interest. The former is an
example of user-based collaborative filtering, where the results from
other _similar users_ are summarized to make recommendations/ The latter
is an example of item-based collaborative filtering, where other
_similar items_ are summarized to make recommendations. Recommendation
systems are often easy to understand conceptually, since they can be
develop from simple association rules (i.e., A goes with B) and have been
frequently used with success by both traditional brick-n-mortar shops
and online sites.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the difference between user and item based recommendation
- Understand the basic concepts of the _a priori_ algorithm
- Understand the basic concepts of frequent itemsets, their construction, and their use in making recommendations.
- Be able to develop a simple recommendation algorithm.

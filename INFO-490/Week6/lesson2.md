# Week 6 Lesson 2 #
## Machine Learning: Introduction to Anomaly Detection ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to the concept of anomaly
detection. An anomaly is simply something that is unexpected or that
does not conform to an expected pattern. Anomaly detection is the search
for these events or observations in a (potentially) large data set.
Anomaly detection is important in many fields, and is used to identify
fraudulent transactions, imposters in social communities, errors in
textual data, issues in medical data (e.g., images), or intrusions in
network data. In some cases, we simply want to identify and remove
outliers to improve the accuracy of a model. In other cases, we are
actually interested in the outliers themselves. As a result, anomaly
detection is a rich field with a number of different approaches
available for use, including within the scikit learn library.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concept of an anomaly.
- Understand the different types of anomalies, including outliers, novelties, or noise.
- Be able to apply scikit learn to detect anomalies.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 3 Lesson 3 #
## Supervised Learning: Naive Bayes ##

In this lesson, you will learn about a third simple supervised learning technique known as Naive Bayes, or NB. Naive Bayes uses the probability for each Attribute belonging to a particular class to make predictions. The naive descriptor relates to the underlying assumption that these probabilities are independent, which is generally not the case. However, this assumption can often be used to easily obtain good results.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind the Naive Bayes algorithm
- Be able to apply Naive Bayes by using the scikit learn library
- Understand the class of problems that are appropriate for the Naive Bayes algorithm.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

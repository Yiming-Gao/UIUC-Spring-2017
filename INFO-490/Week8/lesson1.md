# Week 8 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Social Media: Email ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to social media data, which are a popular source of data for analytics projects. In particular, this lesson focuses on email, which are a rich sort of data based on both overall content as well as the social connections they imply. First, we will review the basic components of an email message: header, body, and (optional) footer. Next, we will discus how to parse an email message to extract the body and possibly useful metadata. Finally, we will look at applying text analytics to emails, specifically to  classify emails as either spam or ham (i.e., bad or good messages).

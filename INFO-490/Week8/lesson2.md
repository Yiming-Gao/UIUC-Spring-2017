# Week 8 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Social Media: Twitter ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to twitter data. Twitter is one of the most popular social media data types due to the wealth of data, the amount of metadata associate with each tweet, and the ease of obtaining twitter data. To access twitter data, we will use a Python library that wraps the official twitter application programming interface (or API). First you will learn how to authenticate by using OAUTH via the twitter API. Next, we will use the twitter API to find specific tweets, analyze the tweet metadata, and to extract a set of tweets. Finally, we will perform a sentiment analysis on twitter data to classify tweets as positive or negative.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to authenticate by using OAUTH 
- Understand the data and metadata contents of a tweet.
- Understand how to search for users and their tweets
- Be able to create an application that analyzes twitter data.

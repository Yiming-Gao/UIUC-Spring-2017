    "In this IPython Notebook, we explore more advanced machine learning techniques with text data. First, we introduce the concept of n-grams, which are combinations of one or more tokens. For example, bigrams are combinations of two tokens, while trigrams are combinations of three tokens. Next, we introduce the concept of stemming, which is used to convert tokens into their root forms so that token frequencies match the use of the root token rather than being spread across multiple similar tokens. Finally, we explore the application of clustering and feature selection to text data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Formally, a [_n-gram_][ngd] is a contiguous sequence of **n** items from a parent sequence of items, such as characters or words in a text document. In general, we will focus solely on words in a document. Thus, our initial approach has simply been to look at unigrams or single words in a document when building a classification model. However, sometimes the combination of words can be more descriptive, for example, _unbelievably bad_ is generally viewed as a more powerful description than just _bad_. As a result, the concept of an _n-gram_ was created, where collections of words can be treated as features. In fact google allows a user to search for [specific n-gram][gnv] combinations in books that they have scanned.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this clearly can improve classification power, it also increases computational requirements. This is a result of the exponential rise in the number of possible features. For example, given $n$ words, we have $n \\times (n - 1)$ possible bigrams, and so on for higher order combinations. While this is not a problem for small vocabularies, for larger vocabularies (and corresponding documents) the number of possible features can quickly become very large. Thus, many text mining applications will make use of Hadoop or Spark clusters to leverage the inherent parallelism in these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate using n-grams, we first demonstrate the concept on a single sentence.\n",

By performing stemming inside this tokenize method, we can return a set of tokens for a document that have been stemmed. In the following code cell, we use a custom `tokenize` method that first builds a list of tokens by using nltk, and then maps the Porter stemmer to the list of tokens to generate a stemmed list.\n",

    "## Dimension Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The document term matrices we have constructed in these examples can become quite large. We have already reduced the number of features used in classification problems by using stop words, by using a consistent case, and by performing stemming. On the other hand, we have enabled exponential increases in the feature space by including n-grams (although we once again restricted the feature space by using the `max_features` or the `max_df` and `min_df` attributes). The traditional dimensional reduction technique we have used in the past is PCA. However, PCA can be difficult to use with text data given the large sizes of the matrices (since a matrix inversion can be required). We can employ alternative techniques, such as incremental PCA or Truncated SVD. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in reality, we are less interested in finding a reduced dimensional space than we are in removing features that contain little or no information (combining features is essentially increasing the ngram range). In this case, the problem of dimension reduction becomes one of optimal feature selection. For this, we can use the scikit learn `SelectKBest` method to identify the best $k$ features. In the following code cells, we first create a vectorizer, train it on data to demonstrate the accuracy and the number of features required to achieve that accuracy. After which, we employ `SelectKBest` to identify the best number of features, where number is predetermined, to achieve a similar accuracy. In the end, we find that less than ten percent of the original features are required to achieve the same level of accuracy.\n",

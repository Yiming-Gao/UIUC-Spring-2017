# Week 9 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to NLP: Semantic Analysis ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to the concept of semantic analysis, where we try to infer the meaning of text data. In part this will build on the concepts of part of speech tagging and named entity recognition presented in Lesson 1. Other concepts, however, are also important, including the relative locations of words, and colocations. To perform semantic analysius, we will develop the word vector space model that underlies to the _word2vec_ appraoch. We will learn to employ word2vec (and other related models) by using the _gensim_ Python library. 

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of semantic analysis
- Be familiar with the word2vec model
- Be able to apply semantic analysis within a Python application

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

# Week 9 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to NLP: Topic Modeling ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to the concept of topic modeling. Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised learning where specific topics, or concepts are derived from documents. The dominant technique for performing topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA. We also will explore the application of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to the construction of topic models. To apply these techniques to text data, we will use both the scikit learn and _gensim_ libraries.

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concept of topic modeling.
- Be familiar with the basic concepts of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
- Be familiar with the basic concepts of Non-negative Matrix Factorization.
- Be able to apply LDA to derive topic models from text documents by using Python.

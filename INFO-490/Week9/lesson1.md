# Week 9 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to NLP: Basic Concepts ##

In this lesson, we will build on the lessons in Week 7 to learn several basic concepts in natural language processing (NLP). First, we will learn, in more detail, the concepts of tokenization, specifically beyond just word level tokens, and how associations between tokens can be important for NLP. We also will learn how to parse larger sections of text such as a sentence or paragraph, including the removal of punctuation. Next, we will learn about tagging text to identify the different grammatical components such as a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. Finally, we will learn about entities and how to perform named entity recognition. 

### Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to token text by paragraph, sentence, or word.
- Be familiar with the basic concepts of part of speech (POS) tagging
- Be familiar with the basic concepts of named entity recognition (NER)
- Be able to apply and use part of speech tagging and named entity recognition in a Python application.

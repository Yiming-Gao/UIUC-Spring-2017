# Week 2 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Logistic Regression ##

In this lesson, you will learn about logistic regression, where regression is performed on a variable which can take a binary value (e.g., True/False or Yes/No) in the simple case, or multiple values in a more advanced categorical case.


### Objectives###
By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Understand the basic concepts of logistic regression.
- Understand the benefits of using Logistic Regression.
- Know how to compute logistic regression by using Python via the `statsmodel` or `scikit_learn` libraries.

### Time Estimate ###
Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ###

_Course Notebook_

- Explore the course [Introduction to Logistic Regression][intro2lr]
  IPython Notebook on the course JupyterHub server.

_Other Material_

- [Logistic Regression][lr] by using Python. Note, they use older Python and IPython constructs (do not use `%pylab`, for example).
- [Wikipedia article on Logistic Regression][wlog] through (at least) the Latent Variable Interpretation.
- Read Section 4 of [Chapter 8, Linear Regression][blr]

_Video_

[Week Two, Lesson 3 video][lv]

#### Optional Additional Readings*

- Section 4.3 from [Elements of Statistical Learning][esl] by Trevor
  Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. Note this text is rather
  mathematical in nature.

_Safari Online Books_

- **Chapter 16: Logistic Regression** from _Data Science from Scratch_, by Joel Grus.

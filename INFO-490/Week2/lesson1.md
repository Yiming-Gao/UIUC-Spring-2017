# Week 2 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Multiple Regression ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to perform regression on multiple variables, as well as understand different statistical quantities that indicate the quality of a computed regression.

### Objectives###
By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Understand how to compute a regression on multiple variables.
- Understand the different statistical measures that quantify the quality of a regression.
- Know how to compute a multiple regression by using the `scikit_learn` and `statsmodel` libraries.

### Time Estimate ###
Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ###

_Course Notebook_

- Explore the course [Multiple Variable Linear Regression][mvregress] IPython
  Notebook on the course JupyterHub server.

_Other Material_

- Introduction of [Wikipedia article on Linear Regression][wlr] (feel free to read more).
- [Simple Linear Regression][bglr] by using Python, including a discussion
  of the fit statistics. Note there is an IPython notebook available at
  the end of the blog post.
- [Multiple Regression][mr] by using Python. Note there is an
  IPython notebook available at the end of the blog post.
- A [blog post][bpsm] explaining the different regression metrics computed by statsmodel.
- Read through Section 3 of [Chapter 8, Linear Regression][blr]

_Video_

#### Optional Additional Readings

- Chapter 11 of [Think Stats][ts], second edition by Allen Downey.
- Section 3.2 from [Introduction to Statistical Learning][isl]  by
  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
- Section 6.1 from [Introduction to Statistical Learning][isl]  by
  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Note
  this section is challenging, but covers choosing the optimal model.
- Section 3.4 from [Elements of Statistical Learning][esl] by Trevor
  Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. Note this text is rather
  mathematical in nature.

_Safari Online Books_

- **Chapter 15: Multiple Regression** from _Data Science from Scratch_, by Joel Grus.

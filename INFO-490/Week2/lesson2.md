# Week 2 Lesson 2#
## Introduction to Regularization ##

In this lesson, you will learn about regularization techniques that can both improve the quality of a fit by reducing the likelihood of overfitting and aid in feature selection.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of regularization (or shrinkage) for linear regression.
- Understand and be able to apply Ridge Regression (L2) by using Python.
- Understand and be able to apply Lasso to Regression problems (L1) by using Python.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

_Course Notebook_

- Explore the course [Introduction to Regularization][regularization] IPython Notebook on the course JupyterHub server.

_Other Material_

- [Regularized Linear Regression][rlr] using Python. Note there is an IPython notebook available at the end of the blog post.
- Introduction and Motivation sections of the [Wikipedia article on Lasso][wlas] (feel free to read more).
- Introduction and History sections of the [Wikipedia article on Ridge Regression][wrid] (feel free to read more).
- Discusion on [Bias-Variance Tradeoff][dbv], which is an important
  factor in reducing the likelihood of overfitting (or underfitting).

#### *Optional Additional Readings*####

- Section 6.2 from [Introduction to Statistical Learning][isl]  by
  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
- Section 3.4 from [Elements of Statistical Learning][esl] by Trevor
  Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. Note this text is rather
  mathematical in nature.

_Safari Online Books_

- Section on _Regularization_ from **Chapter 15: Machine Learning** from _Data Science from Scratch_, by Joel Grus.

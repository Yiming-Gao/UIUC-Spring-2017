# Week 4 Overview #

## Tree Algorithms and Ensemble Techniques ##

This week, you will learn about decision trees and ensemble techniques
that often built on tree algorithms to produce more robust machine
learning predictions. The two main ensemble approaches we will cover are
bagging and boosting, which differ in how weak learners are created and
combined. The random forest algorithm is an example of a bagging
algorithm, which is extremely popular due to its flexibility and ease of
use. Likewise, the gradient boosted tree algorithm (or the similar
Adaboost algorithm) is an example of a popular boosting ensemble
technique. This week, you will learn how to create decision trees, and
how to leverage them to build bagging and boosted ensemble learners.
